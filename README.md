Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project I was given the the bulk of the code for a neural network that would learn to navigate a maze until it reached it's goal. The price of code that I modified and developed was the Deep Q-Learning algorithm which was responsible for choosing the next direction the agent would move. I was given comments on that guided my development, but the code itself was developed by me in this section. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer science is a very broad field and it has ties into virtually every aspect of modern life, but it is still expanding to new applications. Computer scientists are constantly searching for ways to improve and developer computers and their programs to better the lives of people, and AI has been become of of these developments. Using AI and the technology found in simple games like the one of this project, computer scientists hope to advance complex issues in healthcare, finance, security, and simplify tasks for people to more easily accomplish their needs. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem I first consider if I have the skills to solve it, and if not find out how I can learn the skills necessary or find someone who does. Then I break the problem down into all of the parts that I will need, for example, what languages I can uses, what packages will be needs, or what algorithm will be most efficient. After I have these parts broken down I will code each stage to industry standards and debug when necessary. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I have an ethical responsibility to deliver a functional, secure, and complete product to the user. I must also be able to deliver a product to these standards in a timely, cost efficient manner, that aligns with the company or organization I am working for expectations and long term goals.
